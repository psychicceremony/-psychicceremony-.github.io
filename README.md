Site for my radio show and general fun vanity site.
Hello! This is basically what it looks like, me learning html 
in order to make what looks like a geocities site purely for my 
own amusement. If any of the gifs or art I've posted are yours and
you'd like them removed, please let me know, it has never been my 
intention to steal anything. Otherwise I hope stumbling across this
has given you some amount of joy in your life. Peace and love.
